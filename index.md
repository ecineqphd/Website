Welcome to the PhD Ecineq 2023 Workshop on Economic Inequality! This workshop is designed to bring together PhD candidates from diverse fields to explore and discuss the latest research on economic inequality. The workshop provides a platform to share research ideas, receive feedback from peers and senior academics, and establish valuable connections with fellow researchers in the field. Throughout the workshop, participants will have the opportunity to attend presentations, engage in discussions, and network with other attendees. Topics covered will include income and wealth inequality, intergenerational mobility, poverty and social exclusion, and many others. We are excited to offer a dynamic and collaborative environment for young researchers to exchange ideas and foster new research collaborations. We hope that this workshop will inspire and support the next generation of scholars in tackling the complex challenges posed by economic inequality.

* We are inviting applications for the ECINEQ PhD Workshop (online) and ECINEQ PhD Mentoring Programme (in person), which will both take place in July 2023 around the tenth meeting of the Society for the Study of Economic Inequality (ECINEQ), hosted by the AixMarseille School of Economics (July 10 to July 12, 2023).
* The ECINEQ PhD Workshop will take place online on July 6th, 2023. It will bring together PhD students and leading scholars in the field, building community and creating a rich environment for dialogue. PhD students will present a paper, and receive feedback from a PhD discussant, senior scholars, and fellow workshop participants. Senior academics participating include Pr. Cecilia García-Peñalosa, Pr. Stephen Jenkins and Pr. Alain Trannoy.
* The ECINEQ PhD Mentoring Programme will take place in-person during the ECINEQ Conference in Aix-en-Provence, France. PhD students will be paired with a leading scholar to discuss all together both PhD research papers during the lunch break mentoring session. Senior researchers will be chosen among conference participants according to students’ field of study.
* We welcome submissions on any aspect of economic inequality. We encourage students from all disciplines related to economic inequality to apply, including, but not limited to, economics, economic history, political science, sociology and public policy. As the aims of the workshop and mentoring programme are to provide feedback to PhD researchers, we prefer contributions that are not co-authored with established scholars.
* To apply, please submit an extended abstract or a working paper via Google Forms: [https://forms.gle/1V64HsiMnUVJYxy5A](https://forms.gle/1V64HsiMnUVJYxy5A). The deadline for submission is May 18th, 2023.
* Successful applicants will hear back by June 11th, 2023. Submission should be in English and
papers may not exceed 10MB.
* If you are a PhD student and have submitted a paper to participate in this years’ ECINEQ conference, but have not been accepted, you are welcome to re-apply for the PhD workshop.
* Applying to both events is not mandatory. For additional information please contact us: ecineqphd@gmail.com.
