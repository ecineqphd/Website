* The **ECINEQ PhD Workshop** will take place online on **July 6th, 2023.** It will bring together PhD students and leading scholars in the field, building community and creating a rich environment for dialogue. PhD students will present a paper, and receive feedback from a PhD discussant, senior scholars, and fellow workshop participants. Senior academics participating include [Pr. Cecilia García-Peñalosa](https://sites.google.com/view/ceciliagarciapenalosa), [Pr. Stephen Jenkins](https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/_new/people/person.asp?id=7258) and [Pr. Alain Trannoy](https://perso.amse-aixmarseille.fr/trannoy/).


* The **ECINEQ PhD Mentoring Programme** will take place in-person during the **ECINEQ Conference** in Aix-en-Provence, France. PhD students will be paired with a leading scholar to discuss all together both PhD research papers during the lunch break mentoring session. Senior researchers will be chosen among conference participants according to students’ field of study.
* We welcome submissions on any aspect of economic inequality. We encourage students from *all disciplines* related to economic inequality to apply, including, but not limited to, *economics, economic history, political science, sociology and public policy*. As the aims of the workshop and mentoring programme are to provide feedback to PhD researchers, we prefer contributions that are not co-authored with established scholars.
